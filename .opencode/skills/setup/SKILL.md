# Guided Setup

Walk the user through configuring the optional pieces of this plugin. Diagnose
first, then guide only what is actually missing.

## The one rule that outranks convenience

**Never ask the user to paste a bot token, API key, or any other secret into the
chat, and never write one to disk for them.**

This is not generic caution. In this repository there is a concrete path:
anything typed in the conversation is stored in the client's session log (Claude
Code's JSONL), and `agy_session_summary` reads that raw JSONL and embeds it inside
a prompt sent to Gemini. A token pasted here can reach a third-party model through the plugin's
own tooling.

So: tell the user exactly which file to create and which two lines to put in it,
and let them do it in their editor. Then verify **by effect** — send a test
notification and ask whether it arrived — never by reading the value back or
asking them to confirm it in the chat.

If the user offers a token anyway, do not repeat it, do not write it, and do not
acknowledge its value. Say plainly that it belongs only in the `.env` file, and
carry on with the steps.

## Step 1 — Diagnose before proposing anything

Call these three read-only tools and read the actual state. Never guess, and
never walk someone through a step they have already completed. Track E has no
dedicated status tool — diagnose it by reading `statusLine.command` directly
(see Track E below).

| Tool | Tells you |
|---|---|
| `lagrange_agy_status` | `agy` binary path, version, model/effort defaults, permission policy |
| `lagrange_agy_narrate_voices` | whether Voicebox is reachable, which voice profiles exist |
| `lagrange_telegram_bridge_status` | daemon state, which copy of the code each half runs, the effective `.env` path, shared state |

Report a short status of all five tracks, then work only on what is missing.

## Step 2 — The five tracks are independent

Present them as such. A linear installer would push someone who only wanted
desktop notifications into registering a background daemon they do not need.

| Track | Needed for | Optional? |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Antigravity CLI** | everything | No |
| **B. Voicebox** | `agy_narrate`, `agy_say`, voice chat | Yes |
| **C. Telegram outbound** | `telegram_notify`, `telegram_ask`, voice notes to phone | Yes |
| **D. Telegram daemon** | messaging the bot *from* the phone, answering `telegram_ask` | Yes — and it needs C |
| **E. Fanout statusline** | seeing `agy_fanout` progress live, without waiting for the whole batch | Yes — only useful if they use `agy_fanout` |

Ask which ones they want before walking through anything. If they already said
("configurar telegram"), do C, mention D exists, and skip B.

### Track A — Antigravity CLI

From `agy_status`. If the binary is missing or unauthenticated:

1. Install from <https://antigravity.google/cli>.
2. Authenticate: `agy auth login` (or set `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
3. Re-run `agy_status` to confirm.

### Track B — Voicebox (local TTS)

From `agy_narrate_voices`. Voicebox is a separate desktop app the plugin does
not install, but on Windows it does **not** need to stay open: when a voice
tool finds it down, the plugin starts its server headless on its own. What it
needs is the app installed and opened **once**, so it downloads the CUDA
backend and the voice models. If `agy_narrate_voices` reports that no server
binary was found, that first run is what is missing; if it warns that Voicebox
runs on CPU, the CUDA backend is. If it reports profiles, the track is done;
offer `/lagrange/voices` to see them and `/lagrange/narrate` to try one.

GPU memory: `agy_voice_model` (`status`, `pin`, `release`, `unload`) and
`keep_model: true` on the narration tools keep a voice's model loaded; unpinned
models are freed after `voicebox_idle_unload_minutes`. While Voicebox runs, the
statusline shows a Voicebox/VRAM line (`statusline_voicebox: false` hides it).

**Optional: OmniVoice** (second voice engine, Windows + NVIDIA). Much faster
than Qwen (about 6 s for 36 s of audio instead of 70+) and lighter (~2 GB of
VRAM), a bit flatter in prosody. With it installed, what the user waits to hear
now (`agy_say`, `agy_narrate`, voice chat) goes through OmniVoice and what they
asked to hear later (`modo: "diferido"`, session summaries) through Qwen; a
voice can be pinned to one engine with `voz_por_perfil` (e.g. `{"Priscilla":
"voicebox"}` via `agy_set_config`). It clones from the Voicebox voice's sample,
so preset voices keep using Voicebox. Install only if they ask: `npm run
omnivoice:install` downloads ~8 GB (Python 3.12, torch CUDA, weights) into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\lagrange-omnivoice`. Tell them the weights are CC-BY-NC
(non-commercial use).

Non-default port: `voicebox_url` / `voicebox_port` on the narration tools, or
persist it with `agy_set_config`.

**Outside Windows**, the *synthesis* goes over HTTP and works anywhere Voicebox
is listening, but the bridge only knows the on-disk location of the generated
`.wav` files on Windows (`%APPDATA%\sh.voicebox.app`). On Linux or macOS, voice
notes therefore fail with a message saying so, immediately rather than after a
timeout. If they do have Voicebox there, `VOICEBOX_DIR` points at the directory
containing `generations/` and `captures/`. If they do not, say plainly that this
track does not apply on their platform and move on — nothing else in the bridge
depends on it.

### Track C — Telegram outbound

This is the track with real friction, and the `.env` location is the part people
get wrong. Take the exact durable path from `telegram_bridge_status` output
(field: *Ubicación duradera recomendada* / *Estado compartido → Directorio de
datos*) rather than typing a path from memory — it differs per platform and can
be overridden by `TELEGRAM_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR`.

Guide them through:

1. **Bot token** — message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), `/newbot`, follow
   the prompts. It replies with a token. *They keep it; you never see it.*
2. **Numeric user ID** — message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot); it
   replies with their ID. This one is not a secret, but there is no reason to
   have it in the chat either.
3. **Create the file** at the durable path the status tool reported, containing:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<the token from BotFather>
   ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<the numeric id from userinfobot>
   ```
   Point out *why* that path and not next to the code: every plugin version
   installs into its own directory and an update leaves a `.env` there behind,
   silently. `telegram-bridge/.env.example` documents the full search order and
   the other optional settings.
4. **Verify by effect** — call `telegram_notify` with a short test message and
   ask whether it arrived on their phone. If it fails, the error now lists every
   path that was searched; read it back to them rather than speculating.

Common outcomes worth naming:
- *"No hay usuarios configurados"* → the `.env` was not found where the process
  looked. The error enumerates the paths; compare with where they saved it.
- Notification reports success but nothing arrives → they have never sent a
  message to their own bot. Telegram will not let a bot open a conversation;
  they must send it `/start` once.
- Wrong `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` → the bot ignores them silently by design. Re-check
  the ID from @userinfobot.

### Track D — Bidirectional daemon (optional)

Only needed to message the bot *from* the phone or answer `telegram_ask`.
Outbound notifications and voice notes work without it.

**Do not run this yourself.** Give them the commands and let them run them. The
commands are the same on every platform — a dispatcher picks the right service
manager:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KZvilla/lagrange-agent-runtime.git
cd lagrange-agent-runtime
npm install --prefix telegram-bridge
npm run bridge:daemon:install
```

| Platform | Service manager | Logs |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | Task Scheduler, at logon | `telegram-bridge/daemon.log` |
| Linux | `systemd --user` | `journalctl --user -u lagrange-telegram-bridge` |
| macOS | **not supported** — `npm run bridge` in a terminal, or write your own launchd unit | — |

Explain why it must come from a clone: the installer refuses to run from a
managed plugin directory, on both platforms, because the scheduled task and the
systemd unit each store an **absolute path**. Installed from
`plugins/cache/…/<version>/`, the daemon would stay pinned to that version
forever — and since updates do not delete old versions, it would keep running
stale code with nothing failing to reveal it.

**On Linux, do not skip the linger step.** A `systemd --user` service stops when
the user's last session ends and does not start at boot. The installer detects
this and prints the fix, but confirm they ran it:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

Without it the daemon looks fine right after installing and is silently gone
after the next reboot — which is exactly the sort of failure that gets blamed on
the bridge rather than on the missing setting.

Credentials and state are shared, so the clone uses the same `.env` and the same
`state.json` as the installed plugin. They do **not** configure anything twice.

Verify with `telegram_bridge_status`: the service should be `Running` (Windows)
or `active` (Linux) with a live PID. Then have them send `/status` to the bot
from their phone. `npm run bridge:daemon` gives the platform-native view, and on
Linux additionally reports the linger state.

### Track E — Fanout status in the statusline (optional)

> **opencode:** this track relies on Claude Code's `statusLine.command` contract,
> which opencode does not have. In opencode, skip Track E entirely — the fan-out
> still runs and writes its progress logs; use `/lagrange/watch` to follow it.

`agy_fanout` is a single MCP tool call that can block for 15+ minutes with no
intermediate feedback. This track makes its progress visible in the
statusline while it runs, without needing anything from the MCP client beyond
what `statusLine.command` already supports.

**Diagnose first, and never silently overwrite a customized statusline** —
this is the one track where "just install it" would actively break something
the user already has (most commonly `claude-hud`).

1. Read `statusLine.command` from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Three cases:
   - **Not set** — nothing to preserve; skip straight to step 3.
   - **Already our own `fanout-statusline.js`** — track is already active;
     report that and stop.
   - **Anything else** (their own script, `claude-hud`, etc.) — this is the
     one to preserve.

2. If there's something to preserve, save it as the delegate **before**
   touching `statusLine.command`, via:
   ```
   agy_set_config(scope: "global", fanout_statusline_delegate: "<the exact command string from step 1>")
   ```
   Do this before step 3, never after — if it fails, nothing has been
   overwritten yet.

3. Rewrite `statusLine.command` to resolve the installed plugin's *latest*
   version at each invocation, the same way `claude-hud`'s own statusline
   command already does in this environment (never hardcode today's version
   string — the plugin's version directories are never deleted on update, so
   a pinned path silently runs stale code forever, same failure mode already
   called out for the Track D daemon):
   ```
   plugin_dir=$(ls -1d "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/plugins/cache/*/lagrange/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1); exec "node" "${plugin_dir}mcp-server/fanout-statusline.js"
   ```
   If a delegate was saved in step 2, `fanout-statusline.js` runs it itself
   and prepends its output — the statusline command in settings.json only
   ever needs to point at our script.

4. **Verify by effect**, not by assuming the edit worked: confirm the
   statusline still renders whatever it rendered before (if there was a
   delegate), then trigger a small `agy_fanout` (2 trivial disjoint-file
   tasks are enough) and confirm a `🔀 fanout ...` line appears while it runs
   and fades out a few minutes after it finishes.

5. **Reverting**: restore `statusLine.command` to the value saved in
   `fanout_statusline_delegate` (or unset it if there was none), then clear
   `fanout_statusline_delegate` with `agy_set_config`. Disabling just the
   status-file writes without touching the statusline goes through
   `agy_set_config(fanout_statusline: false)` instead — `agy_fanout` still
   runs, it just stops writing the progress file.

## Step 3 — Close honestly

Summarize what is now working and what they chose to skip. If a track failed,
say so plainly with the actual error — do not report a setup as complete because
the steps were followed. The whole point of verifying by effect is that
following the steps and it working are different things.
