# Session Summary Skill

This skill teaches Claude Code and Codex how to generate structured summaries of development sessions by delegating to Antigravity (Gemini).

## Host boundary — mandatory

`agy_session_summary` supports Claude Code by discovering its project JSONL and
supports Codex through the packaged `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` hook. In Codex,
the hook must be trusted so it can register the exact session ID, transcript and
working directory under plugin data. The resolver fails closed when the pointer
is missing, the schema is unknown, or concurrent sessions are ambiguous; never
guess the most recent transcript. If resolution fails, use the host's native
handoff mechanism. Other MCP hosts do not have a session adapter.

## Why This Exists

Claude Code's context window compaction is lossy — it discards details, intermediate decisions, and reasoning when the conversation gets too long. This tool solves that by:

1. Reading the raw session JSONL log (which preserves everything)
2. Pre-processing it to filter noise and fit within Gemini's context window
3. Delegating the summarization to Gemini (1M-2M token window)
4. Saving a persistent markdown document with YAML frontmatter

## When to Use

- **Before compaction**: When the context window is getting full, proactively suggest generating a summary
- **End of session**: When the user is wrapping up work for the day
- **Handoff**: When context needs to be transferred to a new session or team member
- **Documentation**: When the user wants a record of what was accomplished
- **On demand**: When the user asks "what did we do?" or "summarize this session"

## How to Use

### Basic in Claude Code (summarize current session)
```
/lagrange:summary
```

### With focus area
```
/lagrange:summary decisions    → emphasizes architectural/design choices
/lagrange:summary changes      → emphasizes files modified
/lagrange:summary debugging    → emphasizes problems and resolutions
/lagrange:summary handoff      → context transfer for a fresh session
```

`handoff` is not an emphasis, it is a different document: written for an agent
starting cold, it prioritizes findings that exist only in the conversation over
anything recoverable from `git log`, and ends in a copy-paste prompt. Use it
before compacting or when the session is about to end.

### Declaring what must survive (`key_points`)

The single most valuable parameter, and the one most often skipped. Pass short
sentences that YOU know matter and that a reader of the log cannot recover:

```json
{
  "focus": "handoff",
  "key_points": [
    "Verify each gate with its own exit code ($?); never chain assertions with && through a pipe, they mask red tests.",
    "Truncate a command at the line that opens a heredoc (<<), keeping the previous statement.",
    "Rejected: passing the prompt as a CLI argument — over ~24KB it gets offloaded to a file the model may not read."
  ]
}
```

Each point is injected at the top of the prompt as mandatory to preserve, **and
then verified mechanically** in the result by its distinctive terms — a missing
one is a blocking finding.

Why it exists: method rules and invariants were lost in **6 of 6** runs, across
both models, at ~100k input tokens. That is not context saturation — those rules
are diffuse in the transcript and nothing marks them. The agent running the
session does know them.

### Hearing it (`narrate`)

```json
{ "focus": "handoff", "narrate": true }
```

The spoken digest is produced in the *same* call that writes the document, so it
costs no extra round-trip. Do not try to get it by passing the finished document
to `say`: measured on a 36KB handoff, plain narration speaks 1029 characters
(2.8%, cut mid-sentence) and the polish path only ever sees the first 12000
characters — so the pending work and the findings, which live at the end, never
reach the ear. The saved document never contains the digest.

### Verification (`strict`)

A mechanical check **always** runs and cannot hallucinate: it compares the
document against facts extracted from the log and against git — commit SHAs
cited, the version the session actually ended at, file coverage, and the declared
`key_points`. Its findings are reported with every summary.

`strict: true` makes a blocking finding fail the call instead of only reporting
it, and adds a second adversarial pass over the transcript for what a machine
cannot check. **That second pass is advisory and never blocks**: measured, it
returned RECHAZADO accusing a correct document of inventing `daemon.sh`, `bash -n`
and `systemd`, terms that appeared 62, 6 and 71 times in the transcript it was
given. A summarizer that misses material omits; a reviewer that misses material
accuses, and does it in convincing prose.

### Specific session by ID
```
/lagrange:summary 057c77fc-17d4-4ada-86c4-b9f40f2f4d93
```

### Programmatic via MCP tool
```json
{
  "session_id": "057c77fc-17d4-4ada-86c4-b9f40f2f4d93",
  "focus": "decisions",
  "model": "gemini-3.1-pro",
  "output_path": "./docs/session-2026-08-28.md"
}
```

Codex invokes this MCP tool directly. Omit `session_id` when exactly one active
session matches `cwd`; pass the thread UUID when multiple sessions share that
directory. A hook-trust or ambiguity error is a real stop condition, not a cue
to search for another transcript.

## Output Location

Summaries are saved to `~/.claude/session-summaries/<date>-<session-id-short>.md` by default.

Each file includes YAML frontmatter for programmatic access:
```yaml
---
session_id: "057c77fc-..."
project: "c:/vs work/my-project"
branch: "main"
date: "2026-08-28"
start_time: "2026-08-28T10:00:00Z"
end_time: "2026-08-28T14:30:00Z"
summarized_by: "antigravity-mcp"
host: "codex"
host_version: "0.154.0"
---
```

## Proactive Behavior

If you detect that the user's session has been long and productive (many tool calls, multiple files modified), consider suggesting:

> "This has been a productive session. Want me to generate a structured summary before we wrap up?"

Use `/lagrange:summary` in Claude Code or call `agy_session_summary` in Codex.

## Size Handling

| Session Size | Behavior |
|---|---|
| < 100KB | Full transcript sent to Gemini |
| 100KB - 1MB | Filtered (noise removed, tool results condensed) |
| > 1MB | Truncated: first 10 turns + most recent turns that fit in 500K chars |

Above a 700KB preprocessed prompt the tool switches to `gemini-3.1-pro` by itself, because flash loses the
thread on transcripts that long — an 8.3MB session summarised with flash invented a
commit SHA that did not exist in the repository, printed as fact. Passing `model`
explicitly always overrides the choice, and the output says which model ran.

Run `agy models` for the current list. Note that the Pro family only accepts `low`
and `high` effort, so a `medium` inherited from config is raised to `high` (and the
output says so) rather than failing inside agy.
